<h5 align="center">A curated list of awesome resources for Monorepos.</h5>

---

- **[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/):** The mother of monorepos for JavaScript. This repository and the npm packages it provides are and have been the base of thousands of JavaScript monorepos and brought monorepos to JavaScript in a real way.
- **[Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/):** Yarn workspaces are one option to improve monorepo development in JavaScript. Using Yarn's caching and incorporating smart linking, Yarn Workspaces does improve developer experience.
- **[Syncpack](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack):** Syncpack is monorepo dependency management tool. If you've ever struggled with slight dependencies differences across packages or maintaining uniform `package.json` files, then you can imagine the usefulness of Syncpack!
- **[Pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/):** Pnpm is package manager which links node_modules from a single content-addressable storage making installs faster and the `node_module` directory size much smaller. It has workspace functionality and supports everything Lerna does making it a great option for monorepo development when node apps are involved.
- **[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/):** Increments builds, lints, and tests to speed up development. Provides a `globalCache` to share updates between teammates and CI!
